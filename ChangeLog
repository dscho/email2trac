0.2.4 01/11/2005
	Added email_header option if set then show TO/CC fields in

0.2.3 31/10/2005
	Fixed a bug with base64 encoded attachments/emails
	Fixed by: Walter de Jong

0.2.2 10/10/2005
	according to RFC 2368 (titled "the mailto URL scheme") the mailto
	URL can only work with short &body messages. It fails with long
	messages and the link won't work. Therefore the mail body is
	no longer copied into the mail reply.

0.2.1 10/07/2005
	body of reply email looks better


0.2   10/07/2005
	mailto is replaced by a html mailto to line. If 
	you reply to the ticket via this link then an 
	email client is started with some default values:
		To: <reporter>
		Subject: Re: <orginal subject>
		Body: email_comment <orginal text>

	email2trac.conf:
		email_comment: # (default:  >)
