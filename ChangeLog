0.2.2 10/10/2005
	according to RFC 2368 (titled "the mailto URL scheme") the mailto
	URL can only work with short &body messages. It fails with long
	messages and the link won't work. Therefore the mail body is
	no longer copied into the mail reply.

	body of reply email looks better


0.2   10/07/2005
	mailto is replaced by a html mailto to line. If 
	you reply to the ticket via this link then an 
	email client is started with some default values:
		To: <reporter>
		Subject: Re: <orginal subject>
		Body: email_comment <orginal text>

	email2trac.conf:
		email_comment: # (default:  >)
