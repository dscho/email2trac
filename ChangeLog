	* Added ticketing merging. To enable it there are two options for
	  both options enable 'ticket_update' in email2trac.conf
	  1 - Configure trac notification, eg: 
	  	* (ticket address: ticket@test.nl)
	  	[notification]
		smtp_enabled = true
		smtp_always_cc = test@test.nl
		smtp_server = localhost
		smtp_from =  ticket@test.nl
	  	always_notify_reporter = true

	  2 - Use the mailto_cc in email2trac.conf if you want to sent
	      an email to the user and the trac ticket email address.

	  With both options you get the right format of the subject line.

	Fixed a bug with base64 encoded attachments/emails
	Fixed by: Walter de Jong

0.2.2 10/10/2005
	according to RFC 2368 (titled "the mailto URL scheme") the mailto
	URL can only work with short &body messages. It fails with long
	messages and the link won't work. Therefore the mail body is
	no longer copied into the mail reply.

0.2.1 10/07/2005
	body of reply email looks better


0.2   10/07/2005
	mailto is replaced by a html mailto to line. If 
	you reply to the ticket via this link then an 
	email client is started with some default values:
		To: <reporter>
		Subject: Re: <orginal subject>
		Body: email_comment <orginal text>

	email2trac.conf:
		email_comment: # (default:  >)
