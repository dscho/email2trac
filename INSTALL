= Installation and Configuration of email2trac =

The email2trac package contains the following utilities:
 email2trac.py   : converts an email to ticket. Reads a config file 
                   email2trac.conf
 run_email2trac.c: suid program that changes the MTA-user to the TRAC-user so 
                   that we can save attachments
 delete_spam.py  : small program that deletes the SPAM tickets from the database
 email2trac.conf : read by email2trac.py to set the various options. This are 
                   the options:
{{{

== Installation and Configuration ==

First build, install email2trac :

option 1:
  * ./configure (see --help) 
    {{{
    default values for:
       prefix=/usr/local        --> --prefix=<path> 
       exec_prefix=$prefix/bin  --> --exec_prefix=<path>
       sysconfdir=$prefix/etc   --> --sysconfdir=<path>
       MTA_USER=nobody          --> --with-mta_user=<name>
       TRAC_USER=www-data       --> --with-trac_user=<name>
    }}}
  * make
  * make install
  * First install copy emailtrac.conf to $sysconfdir

option 2:
  * debian/rules binary
  * First install copy emailtrac.conf to /etc

After installation, edit email2trac.conf for your site. Most important 
parameter is project, see above

If you have enabled 'ticket_update' in email2trac.conf then you have 
to choose one of these options to make it work:
  1 - Configure trac notification, eg:
      - (ticket address: ticket@test.nl)
      [notification]
      smtp_enabled = true
      smtp_always_cc = test@test.nl
      smtp_server = localhost
      smtp_from =  ticket@test.nl
      always_notify_reporter = true

  2 - Use the mailto_cc in email2trac.conf if you want to sent
      an email to the user and the trac ticket email address via
      the mailto link

== Usage ==

It depends on your MTA how the setup is. For Sendmail and Postfix, the p
rocedure is the same :
 * Edit your alias definition file (default : /etc/aliases for Postfix, 
   /etc/mail/aliases for Sendmail) and add one line per project/component you 
   want to allow ticket submission from email to. For each alias, you can 
   specify option --project. This option selects a configuration stanza in the 
   config file and ''--component'' to specify a component other than the 
   default component for the project. Line must have the following format :
{{{
     tracproj: |"/usr/sbin/run_email2trac [--project=<project_name>] [--component=<project_component>]"
}}}

  * Update your alias database with command ''newaliases''
  * Test with a command like :
{{{
     mail tracproj
}}}

===  Note for Sendmail ===
This is a message from emailtotrac tickets archive:
{{{
Sendmail limits the executables that can be run via aliases to those in a
special directory, and runs them using a restricted shell called smrsh.
On RH, the default location for the allowed programs is /etc/smrsh.

I tried both a link in that dir to the run_email2trac file and a little
shell script that simply calls run_email2trac and passes the params. Both
should work, but neither did yet. Majordomo works the same way, and it
set up on the machine already so I'll check on that later today.

I found a pretty good walk-through of the problem/solution at
http://archives.free.net.ph/message/20030605.105120.74c3bfa8.html

Well, I was in fact doing the right thing. Here's all the steps to follow
post make install

ln -s /usr/local/bin/run_email2trac /etc/smrsh/run_email2trac

in aliases use:

"|run_email2trac -project=bas"

Note: Include the quotes, they are necessary. That got me past the
sendmail problem. No ticket appeared in the project, but I'll look into
that next. Is there a log generated anywhere?
